# JavaScript Null Handling with Loose vs Strict Equality

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to handling null values and the difference between loose equality (`==`) and strict equality (`===`).

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file shows a function that attempts to handle null values using loose equality.  This approach can lead to unexpected results when comparing against null, as loose equality has type coercion involved, which sometimes produces incorrect boolean values.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach.  It uses strict equality (`===`) to avoid the pitfalls of loose equality and ensures that null values are handled correctly.

## Running the Code
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in your preferred JavaScript environment.
3. Run each file to observe the difference in behavior.
